    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "# Intro to Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight we're going to be starting our journey through the Pandas library (created by Wes McKinney). When we refer to working in Pandas, we're typically talking about working within a dataframe, which is what we'll focus on tonight. We'll be diving into Pandas DataFrames, which are objects that will hold our data, allowing us to interact with it, manipulate it, and eventually throw it into machine learning algorithms (if we want). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Pandas DataFrame is an **object**, this means that we're going to interact with it in much the same way that we interact with all of our other objects in python. Before we get to actually interacting with DataFrames, though, we'll have to get one, and get one with data in it! There's one quick step that we have to do before that... \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Import \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd # Standard import. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've shown how we get access to everything in the Pandas library - we import it! Also note the python comment `\"# Standard import\"` out to the right of our import. This was to note that this is the standard way to import the Pandas library. We should always be sure that if we are importing the entire pandas library, we follow this syntax. It's common practice to use `pd` as the alias, and we tend to follow common practice whenever possible. This makes it easier for others to read our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting a DataFrame Object\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic ways that we can get a Pandas DataFrame object to work with. The first is by using data that is already in our Python program, in conjuction with the `DataFrame` constructor. The second is by reading in external data through the pandas module (which remembered we've imported and made accessible via `pd`). For reference, here are the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) for Pandas DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using data already in our Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are using data that is already in our Python program, then we are going to be passing that data to the `DataFrame` constructor. We typically do this in one of two ways. The first involves passing in a list of dictionaries, whereas the second involves passing in two lists. Let's dive into the first..."

    "Each and every one of our Pandas DataFrames will consist of **rows** and **columns**, where the columns will be denoted and accessed via their names, and the rows will be denoted and access via the indices of the DataFrame. Above, we can look at our columns and see that their names are `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We can similiary look at our rows and see that they are indexed by `0` and `1`. These column names and indices are how we will access this data later. How did the `DataFrame` constructor take our list of dictionaries and put it into the DataFrame in that format, though?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Pandas DataFrame constructor encounters a list of dictionaries like we gave it, it interprets each dictionary to be a row in the DataFrame. The keys are read as the column names and the values as the values for each column. By default, the DataFrame constructor will assign a column for **every** key that it sees in **any** dictionary in the list of dictionaries. If a particular dictionary in that list doesn't have a value for that key, then it assigns a `NaN` (stands for not a number) value for that index-column pair. Therefore, when the Pandas DataFrame above got the list of dictionaries, it saw `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` keys, and thus created those columns. It then filled in the values associated with those keys, filling in a `NaN` if it didn't find that key (like it didn't find `d` in the first dictionary in our list). "

    "#### Reading External Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that we can read external data into a Pandas DataFrame, and they will be called as a function that is available via the `pandas` module. As a result of importing the `pandas` module and making it accessible via `pd`, this means that we will call all of these functions via `pd`. Each one of these functions will **return** back to us a Pandas DataFrame object, populated with the external data that we read in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html) will show you all of the ways that you could load external data into a DataFrame. Basically, there is a way to load in data stored in any format (CSV, JSON, SQL, Excel, HTML). All of these take some form of a `read_{data_type}` function, which means that we will call them as `pd.read_{data_type}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to load data in from a CSV, we would simply use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This assumes that we have the column names in the first row of your .csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't have the column names in the first row of our .csv, we could read in the .csv with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv', header=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This by default assigns numbers as the column names (starting with 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to assign the column names as we read it in, we can pass in an additional `names` argument, where this `names` argument holds a list of the names we want to assign to the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv', header=None, names=['col1', 'col2', ...., 'col12'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have looked at a couple of the parameters that we can pass arguments to when reading in data. Just note that the functions that are available to read in data from other sources will likely also have optional parameters that we can specify. "

    "\n",
    "Given that our `DataFrame` is an object, we can imagine that it will have associated attributes and methods. There are a couple of each available to us to get a general sense of our data. We have two attributes that we will frequently use on our DataFrame - these will allow us to look at the shape of our data and the column names. We have four methods that are availiable on our dataframe for getting a general sense of our data: `info()`, `describe()`, `head()`, and `tail()`. Let's take a look at what these do. "
