# Data Science Fundamentals, Accelerated (Adopted for Intro to Data Science course)

The main objective for the __Data Science Fundamentals__ course is for you to leave with a fundamental understanding of programming within Python. For the __Intro to Data Science__ course, we are going to spend our first 2 weeks moving through most of this curriculum so you can learn python fundamentals and be prepared for the data science material later in the course.

If this is your first programming language, then you will feel a very steep learning curve.  The goal of this course is to assist you with overcoming that learning curve, so you can not only continue to grow in this environment, but also start learning from the vast amount of information that is available to you through the online community.  

Having a strong foundation in math/statistics and programming is imperative to success in the data science world.  The aim of this course will be at the foundation of programming.  Often the most difficult part is just getting started.  We are here to help with that process.

In addition, this course will help prepare you for the DSI Technical Interview, which synthesizes Python and Probability/Statistics concepts in order to gauge applicant readiness for the DSI.

### What You’ll Learn / Takeaway:

Whether you’ve programmed in other languages or Python is your first, this class will teach you the nuances of Python and how to use them to your advantage in your data science projects. Here’s what you’ll learn:

* Environment Setup
* Data Scientist Workflow
* Ins and Outs of Coding Pythonically
* Object Oriented Programming
* Popular Data Science Libraries including Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn

### Who Should Take this Class?

For those of you interested in learning to program in Python, so you may be better prepared for self study in data science, this course will help you get up to speed.  Those of you who are interested in gaining the skills required for admittance to the Data Science Immersive; this course is designed to help you meet that bar.
